something i'm very happy about is getting a new car :) a beautiful 2024 toyota corolla xse. her name is draculaura because she's my favorite monster high character & she's black and pink!!

## hobbies

i've been playing video games since i was a little kid & it's always been my main hobby growing up. i started with online games, like poptropica and webkinz, then moved on to minecraft and league of legends. when valorant came out in 2020 it took over my life and is ultimately the game i play the most now!

i have achieved some noteable things in valorant - i played on the girl's esports team for it at ucsd for 3/4 years i was there and i hit immortal (top 0.2% of players!). i have been playing it less to focus on adulting but it is still one of my proud interests :)
i also enjoy other more casual video games like stardew valley and sims!

outside of video games, i love reading books, listening to music and watching old movies :) i love collecting old dvds, vhs tapes, and cds. physical media is superior!

## goals

by the end of summer 2025 i want to:

- learn embroidery
- burn music cds
- do a valorant project
- do a bioinformatics related project
- get a job... hopefully haha

by 10 years from now i hope to:

- have a secure and, more importantly, fun!! job :) 
- live with my boyfriend (and hopefully husband) james <3 
- have a kid or be stable enough to consider a family
- improve and expand my skills
- maybe? go to grad school and earn a masters or phd
